# 2D-Collision-Simulation
Tried using scalar quantities to implement this and realized that that is not the way to do this.
Used Vector math instead and realized that Math is Boss.

###Bugs that need to be killed
* Spheres spawning with an overlap end up sticking together. It looks cool sometimes but it needs to go.

###Features to be added

* Interactivity
