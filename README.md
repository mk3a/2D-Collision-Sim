# 2D-Collision-Simulation
Tried using scalar quantities to implement this and realized that that is not the way to do this.
Used Vector math instead and realized that Math is Boss.

Check out the demo at http://mk3a.github.io/2dColSim.html . Click inside box to create spheres.

###Features to be added
* Electric Charge Simulator
* ~~Interactivity~~
